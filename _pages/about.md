I am broadly interested in various fluid mechanics and transport phenomena, and their applications in energy and environmental engineering. During my PhD, I studied thin film flow in melting, ion transport in electrochemical cells, and heat and mass transfer of multiphase fluids in porous media, using theoretical, experimental, and simulation methods. Currently, I am working on non-isothermal low-Reynolds flow, including viscoelastic fluids, slip effects, and phase transition processes.

Phase Transition 
======
Melting
------
Melting is a common and widely studied phenomenon. My research focuses on a specific type of melting, namely contact melting. I investigate its associated flow and heat transfer processes, including the non-Newtonian characteristics and special effects such as interfacial slip. Additionally, I am dedicated to applying these findings to rapid charging in phase change thermal energy storage systems.

Evaporation and Boiling
------
The processes of evaporation and boiling in porous media are closely related to energy and environmental challenges, such as high-performance heat dissipation surfaces, solar-thermal interface evaporation for water purification, and thermal treatment of organic pollutants in soil. My research focuses on understanding and describing the gas-liquid migration and phase change processes involved, with the aim of providing insights for efficient heat dissipation and water and soil purification

Transportation in Electrochemical System
======
Electrochemical systems often involve complex multi-physics transport phenomena and chemical reactions, encompassing the transport of chemical species, charge, fluid, and heat. My research interests focus on understanding the underlying transport mechanisms, such as instability phenomena and local convection induced by electrokinetic slip, with the goal of developing analytical tools for applications in energy storage systems, such as batteries, and electrochemical catalysis.

Viscoelastic fluids
======
Viscoelastic fluids, including polymer solutions, gels, and melts, are widely used in energy and environmental engineering applications. Currently, my research focuses on accurately measuring the relaxation time of low-viscoelastic polymer solutions and studying the stability of pressure drop during the flow of viscoelastic fluids. In the future, I aim to explore the potential applications of viscoelastic fluids in electrochemical energy storage and environmental remediation.
