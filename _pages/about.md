I have a broad interest in **fluid mechanics and transport phenomena**, particularly their applications in **energy and environmental engineering**. During my Ph.D., I investigated **thin film flow in melting, ion transport in electrochemical cells, and heat and mass transfer of multiphase fluids in porous media**, employing **theoretical analysis, experiments, and simulations**. Currently, my research focuses on **non-isothermal low-Reynolds-number flows**, exploring key aspects such as **viscoelastic fluid behavior, interfacial slip effects, and phase transition processes** to advance our understanding of complex fluid systems.

Phase Transition 
======

Melting
------
Melting is a fundamental phenomenon that has been extensively studied across various disciplines. My research focuses on a specialized form of melting—close-contact melting—wherein I investigate the intricate flow and heat transfer processes involved. This includes exploring non-Newtonian behaviors and unique effects such as interfacial slip, which influence the dynamics of melting. Furthermore, I am committed to applying these insights to enhance the efficiency of rapid charging in phase change thermal energy storage systems, contributing to advancements in energy storage and thermal management technologies.

Evaporation and Boiling
------
The processes of evaporation and boiling in porous media are fundamentally linked to critical energy and environmental challenges, including high-performance heat dissipation surfaces, solar-thermal interface evaporation for water purification, and the thermal treatment of organic pollutants in soil. My research aims to elucidate the mechanisms governing gas-liquid migration and phase change in these systems, providing valuable insights to enhance heat dissipation efficiency and optimize water and soil purification strategies.

Transportation in Electrochemical System
======
Electrochemical systems inherently involve complex multi-physics transport phenomena and coupled chemical reactions, including the transport of chemical species, charge, fluid, and heat. My research focuses on elucidating the fundamental transport mechanisms governing these systems, particularly instability phenomena and local convection induced by electrokinetic slip. By advancing our understanding of these processes, I aim to develop analytical tools that enhance the performance and efficiency of **energy storage systems**, such as batteries, and **electrochemical catalysis**, contributing to innovations in sustainable energy technologies.

Viscoelastic fluids
======
Viscoelastic fluids, including polymer solutions, gels, and melts, play a crucial role in various energy and environmental engineering applications. My current research focuses on **precisely measuring the relaxation time of low-viscoelastic polymer solutions** and investigating the **stability of pressure drop** during viscoelastic fluid flow. Looking ahead, I aim to explore the **potential applications of viscoelastic fluids in electrochemical energy storage and environmental remediation**, leveraging their unique rheological properties to enhance system performance and efficiency.
