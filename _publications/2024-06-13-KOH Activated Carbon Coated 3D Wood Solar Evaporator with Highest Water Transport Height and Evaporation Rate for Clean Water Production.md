The water evaporation rate of 3D solar evaporator heavily relies on the water transport height of the evaporator. In this work, a 3D solar evaporator featuring a soil capillary-like structure is designed by surface coating native balsa wood using potassium hydroxide activated carbon (KAC). This KAC-coated wood evaporator can transport water up to 32 cm, surpassing that of native wood by ≈8 times. Moreover, under 1 kW m−2 solar radiation without wind, the KAC-coated wood evaporator exhibits a remarkable water evaporation rate of 25.3 kg m−2 h−1, ranking among the highest compared with other reported evaporators. The exceptional water transport capabilities of the KAC-coated wood should be attributed to the black and hydrophilic KAC film, which creates a porous network resembling a soil capillary structure to facilitate efficient water transport. In the porous network of coated KAC film, the small internal pores play a pivotal role in achieving rapid capillary condensation, while the larger interstitial channels store condensed water, further promoting water transport up more and micropore capillary condensation. Moreover, this innovative design demonstrates efficacy in retarding phenol from wastewater through absorption onto the coated KAC film, thus presenting a new avenue for high-efficiency clean water production.
