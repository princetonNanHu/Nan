title: "Tackling realistic Li+ flux for high-energy lithium metal batteries"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'we establish a mechanistic model to decipher how the SEI affects Li plating in high-fluorine electrolytes, inspiring the design of an efficient electrolyte that generates dual-halide SEI to homogenize Li+ distribution and Li deposition.'
