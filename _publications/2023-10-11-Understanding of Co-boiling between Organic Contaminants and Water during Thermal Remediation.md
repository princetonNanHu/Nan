In situ thermal desorption (ISTD) provides an efficient solution to remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated with nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). Establishing a relationship between the subsurface temperature rise and NAPL removal is significant to reduce energy consumption of ISTD. However, the co-boiling phenomenon between NAPL and water poses a great challenge in developing this relationship due to the nonequilibrium heat and mass transport effects. We performed a systematic experimental investigation into the local temperature rise patterns at different distances from a NAPL pool and under different degrees of superheat by selecting four representative NAPLs (i.e., trichloroethylene, tetrachlorethylene, n-hexane, and n-octane) according to their density and boiling point relative to water. The patterns of temperature rise indicated that the underground temperature field can be divided into three zones: the zone of local thermal equilibrium, the nonequilibrium zone affected by co-boiling, and the zone unaffected by co-boiling. We developed a pattern-recognition-based approach, which considers the effects of local heat and mass transport to establish a qualitative correlation between the temperature rise and NAPL removal. Our results give deeper insights into the understanding of subsurface temperatures in ISTD practice, which can serve as the guideline for more accurate and sustainable remediation.
