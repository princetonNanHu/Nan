We investigate the dynamics of close-contact melting (CCM) on gas-trapped hydrophobic surfaces, with specific focus on the effects of geometrical confinement and the liquid-air meniscus below the liquid film. By employing dual-series and perturbation methods, we obtain numerical solutions for the effective slip lengths associated with velocity λ and temperature λt fields, across various values of aspect ratio Λ (defined as the ratio of the film thickness h to the structure's periodic length l) and gas-liquid fraction ϕ. Asymptotic solutions of λ and λt for Λ≪1 and Λ≫1 are derived and summarized for different surface structures, interface shapes and Λ, which reveal a different trend for λ and Λ≪1 and the presence of a meniscus. In the context of constant-pressure CCM, our results indicate that transverse-grooves surfaces consistently reduced the heat transfer. However, longitudinal grooves can enhance heat transfer under the effects of confinement and meniscus when Λ⪅0.1 and ϕ<1−0.52/3≈0.37. For gravity-driven CCM, the parameters of l and ϕ determine whether the melting rate is enhanced, reduced, or nearly unaffected. We construct a phase diagram based on the parameter matrix (log10l,ϕ)to delineate these three regimes. Lastly, we derived two asymptotic solutions for predicting the variation in time of the unmelted solid height.
